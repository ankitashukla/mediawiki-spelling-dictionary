spelling-dictionary-opw
=======================
Spelling dictionaries for the major languages of the world (English, Italian, French) help make Wikipedia articles in these languages more readable and professional and provide an opportunity for participation in improving spelling. 
Many languages, however, donâ€™t have spelling dictionaries. 

This project aims at developing a collaborative dictionary which shall also have an additional feature of checking spellings of the words. 
This is to be achieved with the collaborative efforts of the mediawiki community using crowd-sourcing, as a MediaWiki extension integrated with VisualEditor, and possibly using Wikidata as a backend. We need to create something that's useful as VE module. 

The essence of the project shall aim to develop an admin panel where the administrator/moderator will be able to manage the submissions: verify the suggested spellings of the words, accept them, reject them, filter and build new versions of the spelling dictionary upon them. A simple start to the project could be by starting with a simple list of words.
